Geotechnical Engineering
Example: Foundation Design for a High-Rise Building

Components: Soil analysis, foundation type selection (e.g., shallow or deep foundations).
Process:
Soil Investigation: Conduct borehole drilling and soil sampling.
Lab Testing: Analyze soil samples for properties like bearing capacity and shear strength.
Foundation Design: Determine the appropriate foundation type (e.g., pile foundation for weak soils).
Construction: Excavate the site, install piles or other foundation elements, and pour concrete.
Monitoring: Use sensors and regular inspections to ensure foundation stability over time.
