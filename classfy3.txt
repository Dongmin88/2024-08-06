Structural Engineering
Example: Design of a Suspension Bridge

Components: Towers, cables, deck, anchorages.
Process:
Site Selection and Survey: Assess the geographical and environmental conditions.
Design Phase: Create detailed designs and simulations using CAD software.
Materials Selection: Choose appropriate materials such as steel for cables and concrete for towers.
Construction: Build towers, install cables, and construct the bridge deck.
Testing and Inspection: Perform load tests and safety inspections.
